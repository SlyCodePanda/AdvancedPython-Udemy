#Magic Functions

You can use these functions to <b>override</b> symbols to do whatever you want.
Any function that starts and ends with two underscores is a magic method.

There are 4 different types of magic functions in Python:
1. Binary Operators : +, -, *, etc.
2. Unary Operators: -(neg), +(pos), ~(invert), etc.
3. Comparison Operators: <, >, ==, <=, !=, etc.
4. Extended Assignments Operators: +=, -=, /=, etc.
